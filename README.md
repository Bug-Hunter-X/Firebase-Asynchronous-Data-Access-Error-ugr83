# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching and how to solve it.
The bug occurs when trying to access properties of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This leads to unexpected behavior such as `undefined` or `null` values and often crashes the application.

The solution demonstrates best practices to handle asynchronous operations in Firebase, ensuring data is available before attempting to access its properties.
